# 0x00. C - Hello, World

## General
- Creating shell scripts to process `C` files in the different steps of creating the execution file: `preprocessing`, `compile`, `assembly`, `linker`.
- Using basic C functions: `puts`, `printf`, `sizeof`.
- Advanced tasks: searching `gcc` options for different styles (e.g., `intel syntax`), searching for low-level C functions that do the same job as `puts` or `printf`.

## Commands
- `gcc`
- `printf (3)`
- `puts`
- `putchar`
