# 0x00. C - Hello, World
# General: 
- creating shell scripts to process `C` file in the different steps of creating the execution file: `preprocessing`, `compile`, `assembly`, `linker`
- Using basic c functions: `puts`, `printf`, `sizeof`
- Advanced tasks : searching `gcc` option for different styles `intel syntax`, searching for low-level O function do the same job as `puts` or `printf` 
# Commands :
   - gcc
   - printf (3)
   - puts
   - putchar
# Concepts: 
- steps taken to create the exe file and simple c code
