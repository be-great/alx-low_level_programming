|File | description|
|---|---|
|0-strcat|function that concatenates two strings.|
|1-strncat|function that concatenates two strings.it will use at most n bytes from src; and|

|102-magic| Add one line to <a href="https://github.com/alx-tools/make_magic_happen/blob/master/magic.c">this code<a>, so that the program prints a[2] = 98, followed by a new line.|
|103-infinite_add|function that adds two numbers. add two numbers represented as strings we use three steps : (check if the buffer size enough, add digit by digit and store it in the buffer, reverse the content of the buffer because we store the addition in reverse)|
|104-print_buffer| function that prints a buffer. we have three-part (memory part, string in hexadecimal , the string)|
