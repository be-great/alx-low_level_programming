2. binary algorithm 
repeatedly dividing the search interval in half and check the mid only everytime

3. jump algorithm
assuming the array is sorted
we divide the array by squre of the length of the array. and check the last element is>= the element we searhing for. if yes we sure that group in a linear search.
