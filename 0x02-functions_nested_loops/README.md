# 0x02. C - Functions, nested loops
## General
    What are nested loops and how to use them
    What is a function and how do you use functions
    What is the difference between a declaration and a definition of a function
    What is a prototype
    Scope of variables
    What are the gcc flags -Wall -Werror -pedantic -Wextra -std=gnu89
    What are header files and how to to use them with #include
## Function Creating 
Creating function from scratch: `putchar`, `islower`, `isalpha`, `abs`.
# Files 
| File | Description |
| --- | --- |
|  0. _putchar  |  a program that prints _putchar, followed by a new line. |
| 1-alphabet |  function that prints the alphabet, in lowercase, followed by a new line. |
| 2-print_alphabet_x10 | function that prints 10 times the alphabet, in lowercase, followed by a new line. |
| 3-islower | function that checks for lowercase character.  |
| 4-isalpha | function that checks for alphabetic character.  |
| 5-sign |  function that prints the sign of a number.|
| 6-abs | function that computes the absolute value of an integer. |
| 7-print_last_digit | function that prints the last digit of a number. |
| 8-24_hours | function that prints every minute of the day of Jack Bauer, starting from 00:00 to 23:59. |
|9-times_table | function that prints the 9 times table, starting with 0.|
|10-add | function that adds two integers and returns the result.|
|11-print_to_98 | function that prints all natural numbers from n to 98, followed by a new line.|
|100-times_table|function that prints the n times table, starting with 0.|
|101-natural|If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23. Write a program that computes and prints the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1024 (excluded), followed by a new line.|
|102-fibonacci| program that prints the first 50 Fibonacci numbers, starting with 1 and 2, followed by a new line.|
|103-fibonacci|Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89. By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed 4,000,000, write a program that finds and prints the sum of the even-valued terms, followed by a new line.|
|104-fibonacci|program that finds and prints the first 98 Fibonacci numbers, starting with 1 and 2, followed by a new line.|

## Algorithms Notes
- using `%`: to extract the last digit of a number, `/`: to extract the first digit of a number
example: 12%10 = 2 , 12/10 = 1 "because it's integer"
- Note in `104-fibonacci` the sequence of the numbers become bigger and bigger and we notice that the `unsigned long` can't fit anymore , so we split the numbers into two part to display it in the O standard function `printf`
